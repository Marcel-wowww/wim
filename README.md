# Installation #

## Prerequisites ##
Download and install the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).

Note that the docker projects have to be somewhere under your home directory in order to work (limitation for Mac and Windows).


## Steps ##

1. Start a docker machine (docker quickstart icon).

2. Clone this repository to the directory of your choice (within your home directory).
    **Mind that it should be cloned into the _profiles/wim_ folder in order to work well.**
    ```
    git clone git://github.com:WebsiteIntranetModel/wim.git profiles/wim
    ```

3. Go inside the folder in which you cloned this repository (where the docker-compose.yml file is).

4. Build and start the docker containers.
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will build multiple containers (see the Dockerfile in docker_build/) and all the dependencies.

5. Add wim.dev and mailcatcher.wim.dev to your /etc/hosts file based on the ip of the docker machine.

    If necessary you can find the IP with this command on your host machine:
    ```
    docker-machine ls
    ```

6. Run the install script on the docker web container.

    Add _include_ as second parameter to include local development settings to the settings.php file. Skip it if you don't want this.
    ```
    docker exec -it wim_web bash /root/dev-scripts/install/install-script.sh install include
    ```

    Add develop as third parameter to install development modules from drupal-org-dev.make file.
    ```
    docker exec -it wim_web bash /root/dev-scripts/install/install-script.sh reinstall include develop
    ```

    Add demo content. In order to remove demo content add _remove_ parameter.
    ```
    docker exec -it wim_web bash /root/dev-scripts/democontent.sh
    ```

7. Running into trouble?

    **wim_db port in use**
    Edit the docker-compose.yml file in the root of the repo and change the database port mapping `3308:3006` to for example `3309:3306` or another unused port.

## Usage ##

**If you want to see which containers are running:**
```
docker ps
```

**SSH into the container:**
```
docker exec -it wim_web bash
```
Here you can use _drush_ and _drupal list_.

**If you want to re-install, use the install script with the _reinstall_ parameter:**

Add _include_ as second parameter to include local development settings to the settings.php file. Skip it if you don't want this.

```
docker exec -it wim_web bash /root/dev-scripts/install/install-script.sh reinstall include
```

**If you want to check coding standards:**

Add _full_ as parameter if you want to see a detailed list of errors, skip it to see just a summary of files with issues.

```
docker exec -it wim_web bash /root/dev-scripts/check-coding-standards.sh full
```

**To view emails go to:**
```
mailcatcher.wim.dev
```
